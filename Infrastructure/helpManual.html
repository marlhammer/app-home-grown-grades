&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Welcome to Home Grown Grades: a program written by homeschoolers and for homeschoolers, to make homeschooling easier. Home Grown Grades will be abbreviated as HGG.<br><br>

<center><font color=red><b>GENERAL INFORMATION</b></font><br></center>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; HGG is organized simply. You create students (one student for each of your children) and subjects to go along with each student (representing the courses that child is taking). You can then quickly and easily add percent grades and keep track of cumulative scores throughout the year. Other tools are provided to help you calculate percents, assign "weights" to different grade categories (e.g., Homework, Test, Quiz, Other Work), and secure your data with passwords and backups.<br><br>


<center><font color=red><b>STUDENT MANAGEMENT</b></font><br></center>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At the top of the screen is a menu with white text that says <b>Students</b>.
When you click on <b>Students</b>, you will see three options: New, Delete and Change Name. (Delete and Change Name are grayed out until the first student name is created.)<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<font color=blue>Creating Students:</font> Click on <b>New</b>, and a dialog box will appear. Type in a student name and click OK. A button will now display that student's name. Each student name that is created will become part of a drop-down list from that button, and you will be able to select whichever student you need from that drop-down list. The button will display the name of the student whose account you are currently working on.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;NOTE: You have two options for your multi-year planning.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Option #1: You may re-use the same student names each year. Disadvantage: At the end of each school year, you need to store your data somewhere else and then delete all the grades and subjects you created for that year under that student name. <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Option #2: (Recommended) You may use a year name or grade name connected with the name of the student (for example: Adam-2003 or Rebecca, 10th grade) and then just add new students (for example: Adam-2004 or Rebecca, 11th grade) and subjects the following year. HGG can accommodate up to 144 students; so it should not be a problem to keep several years' worth of grades stored in this program.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<font color=blue>Deleting Students:</font> Click on the student's name from the drop-down list; then click on the <b>Delete</b> option from the <b>Students</b> menu. A dialog box will ask you if you are sure you want to delete this student; click OK.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<font color=blue>Changing Student Names:</font> Click on the student's name from the drop-down list; then click on the <b>Change Name</b> option from the <b>Students</b> menu. In the dialog box type in the new name and click OK.<br><br>

<center><font color=red><b>SUBJECT MANAGEMENT</b></font><br></center>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now that you have your student(s) in place, you can start adding subjects. There is now a second menu with white text at the top of the program called <b>Subjects</b>. It has the same options as the <b>Students</b> menu had--New, Delete and Change Name. (Delete and Change Name are grayed out until the first student name is created.)<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<font color=blue>Creating New Subjects:</font> Select the student's name from the drop-down list and then choose <b>New</b> from the <b>Subjects</b> menu. In the dialog box type in a course name (for example: World History, Latin, Spanish 2, Geometry, Science, Math, Micro-Economics, Robotics and Applied Technology, etc.) and click OK. Continue this process until you have added all the subjects for that student. You may repeat this process for all your students.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<font color=blue>Deleting Subjects:</font> Select the subject's name from the drop-down list and then choose <b>Delete</b> from the <b>Subjects</b> menu.  A dialog box will ask if you are sure you want to delete this subject; click OK.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<font color=blue>Changing Subject Names:</font> Select the subject's name from the drop-down list and then choose <b>Change Name</b> from the <b>Subjects</b> menu. In the dialog box type in the new name and click OK.<br><br>


<center><font color=red><b>GRADE MANAGEMENT</b></font><br></center>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As soon as at least one student and subject are created, several new buttons will appear, including four buttons at the top (Add Grade, Delete Grade, Change Grade, Change Weights) and one at the bottom (Weighting is OFF). Some of them may be grayed out if you do not yet have any grades recorded.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<font color=blue>Adding Grades:</font> Make sure you have selected the student and subject you wish to add grades to. Click on the <b>Add Grade</b> button and choose from the pop-up menu one of the categories of grades. (The categories are Homework, Test, Quiz, and Other Work.) HGG divides grades into four categories so you can organize them more easily, especially if you want to assign different weights to different categories. (For example, you may want tests to be "worth more" than homework assignments in the overall grade percent. Further explanation as to how to weight grades follows in the next section.) In the dialog box type the percentage grade, with or without the percent sign (for example: 98 or 98%; 83 or 83%) and click OK. Note: The number will appear on the screen without the % sign. (You may want to refer to a later section under <b>Tools</b> for an explanation of the <b>Fraction Calculator</b> to help you compute percentage grades.) The screen now displays the percentage grade you have entered, numbered by the order of entry, and the average so far for that grade category.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<font color=blue>Deleting Grades:</font> Make sure you have selected the student and subject you wish to delete grades from. Click on the <b>Delete Grade</b> button and choose from the pop-up menu the category (Homework, Test, Quiz, Other Work) of the grade you wish to delete. In the dialog box type in the grade number (NOT the percentage grade) of the grade you wish to delete (see Important Note below) and click OK.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<font color=blue>Changing Grades:</font> Make sure you have selected the student and subject you wish to change grades for. Click on the <b>Change Grade</b> button and choose from the pop-up menu the category (Homework, Test, Quiz, Other Work) of the grade you wish to change. In the dialog box type in the grade number of the grade you wish to change (see Important Note below) and click OK. A second dialog box will ask you for the new percentage grade (for example: 98 or 98%, etc.); then click OK.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;IMPORTANT NOTE: Whenever you try to delete or change a grade, you will need to enter the <b>grade number</b>. This number is <b>NOT</b> the percentage grade but rather the number assigned to the grade by the computer when the grade was entered. You will need to enter the <b>number that appears to the far left of the grade</b>, with or without the pound sign. (For example: If you entered 10 homework grades, and you'd like to delete or change the third one, you would type in #3 or 3 when asked for the grade number you would like to delete or change.)<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<font color=blue>Weighting Grades:</font> The button at the bottom of the screen that says <b>WEIGHTING IS OFF</b> or <b>WEIGHTING IS ON</b> controls grade weighting. Clicking on this button switches the weighting feature "on" and "off." Weighting grades basically means you assign a <b>percentage</b> (out of a hundred percent) for each category to be worth in the value of the total cumulative average of all four categories (Homework, Test, Quiz, Other Work). For example, if you weight Homework grades at 40% and Test grades at 60%, then all the homework grades you enter are going to be worth 40% of the total cumulative average, and all the test grades you enter will be worth 60% of the total cumulative average. If you activate the weighting feature, the total of all the grade categories you give weight to must add up to 100 percent. A cumulative average (the total, weighted average of all categories of grades) will appear as long as there are grades in each category that is weighted. To weight grades, follow these steps:<br><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>(1)</b> Click the WEIGHTING IS OFF button; it will change to WEIGHTING IS ON. Make sure you have selected the student and subject you wish to weight grades for.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>(2)</b> Click the <b>Change Weights</b> button and select the category of grades (Homework, Test, Quiz, Other Work) you wish to add a weight to.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>(3)</b> In the dialog box type the percentage number (with or without the % sign) you wish to assign to this category. This value will represent its "worth" in the total cumulative average.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>(4)</b> Continue Steps #2 and #3 until you have assigned weights to whatever categories you wish. Remember that the total of all the categories must add up to 100% for this feature to be activated. (For example: You may wish to have homework worth 40%, tests worth 30%, and quizzes worth 30%. You may choose in this case to ignore the "other work" category.)<br><br>


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Weight values can be changed at any time. Error messages may appear in white at the bottom of your screen to alert you to corrections that need to be made.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After your categories are weighted and grades are entered into all weighted categories, the weighted grade average (which is the cumulative average according to the weights you have set) will appear in white at the bottom of your screen.<br><br>


<center><font color=red><b>OTHER HELPFUL TOOLS</b></font><br></center>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The menu bar at the top of the screen also features File, Edit, Tools and Help buttons.<br><br>

<b>FILE BUTTON:</b> File has three options: Save, Exit and Backup.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<font color=blue>Save:</font> Clicking on this button will save your current work on the program.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<font color=blue>Exit:</font> Clicking on this button will exit the program. A dialog box will always ask if you want to save your changes when you exit (provided you have made any changes!)<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<font color=blue>Backup:</font> Clicking on this button will offer you two choices for backing up your data: <b>Make Backup</b> and <b>Restore Backup</b>. Making a backup is copying the information to another source (a hard drive on your computer or a floppy disk which can be stored separately from your computer). Restoring a backup is retrieving that stored information and plugging it back into the HGG program (perhaps in a response to a computer crash or accidental erasure of data). Both backup options can be activated from this program very similarly.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<font color=blue>Making A Backup:</font> Click on the <b>Make Backup</b> button and choose from the dialog box where you want to create the backup file, following the detailed directions below. (I recommend that you save your backups on removable disks rather than on a hard drive of your computer. Removable disks can be stored at a friend's house or in a fire-safe and are not lost if your computer crashes or if you have a house fire.) To save on a floppy disk: Select your floppy disk drive from the dialog box. (On computers with the Windows operating system, the default drive is A:\ as the floppy disk drive.) Insert a floppy disk into the drive and click OK. To save to a hard drive on your computer: Click on the drive you want from the drop-down button in the lower right corner of the dialog box, choose the directory (by double-clicking on it) you wish the save the files in, and click OK.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<font color=blue>Restoring A Backup:</font> Click on the <b>Restore Backup</b> button and choose from the dialog box from where you want to draw the backup file information. To restore from a floppy disk: Insert the disk into your computer, select the floppy disk drive from the drop-down button in the lower right corner of the dialog box (usually the A:\ drive), and click OK. To restore from a hard drive from your computer: Select from the drop-down button in the lower right corner of the dialog box the drive (and then double-click on the directory) the files are saved on and click OK.<br><br>


<b>EDIT BUTTON:</b> This option is available only when you have both a student and a subject selected. Edit has only one option: <b>Copy Text</b>. Copy Text allows you to "copy" the text from the grade categories in order to "paste" that text into a word processing program, perhaps for the purpose of printing out the grades for a report card or transcript.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Select the student and subject for the grades you wish to copy. Click the "Copy Text" button. (This accomplishes the same thing as highlighting text and pressing Control C. Either procedure can be used.) Choose the category of grades (Homework, Test, Quiz, Other Work) you wish to copy. Only one category can be copied at a time. Open a new file in your word processing software, and either press Control V or select "Edit" from the toolbar and the "paste" feature to bring the information into your word processing file.<br><br>


<b>TOOLS BUTTON:</b> Tools has three options: Fraction Calculator, Password Controls, and Set Background Color.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<font color=blue>Fraction Calculator</font> converts fractional scores into decimal grades. When you click on this button, a dialog box pops up with two text fields. First enter the number of total correct points the student earned for the assignment; then enter the total number of points possible to be earned for the assignment. The fraction calculator will display the decimal grade. (For example, if you had an assignment worth 23 points, and your student got 19.5 points correct, you would enter the 19.5 first, and the 23 second. The resulting percentage grade would be rounded to the nearest hundredth--84.78.)<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<font color=blue>Password Controls</font> allows you to set a password for the program (to prevent someone else from changing the grades). The first time you click on <b>Password Controls</b>, you will see one option: <b>Turn Password ON</b>. The first time you turn the password feature "on," a dialog box will appear; type in your new password and click OK. The next dialog box will ask you to repeat it, for a safeguard against a mis-type. Type it in the second time and click OK. A message box will confirm to you that the password feature has been turned on.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once you have set a password, you can change it to something new by clicking on <b>Password Controls</b>, then <b>Change Password</b>; type in the new password and click OK. You will then be prompted by a second dialog box to repeat that procedure, again for a safeguard against a mis-type. A message box will again confirm to you that the password feature has been turned on.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you forget your password, contact me through my website (written on the CD front), and I'll do my best to help you.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<font color=blue>Set Background Color</font> is an option added for fun. It allows you to choose a color scheme for the program. When you click on this button, it offers you a list of preset colors (Gray, Blue, Green, Red, Cyan, Magenta, Orange) to click on or an option to select a CUSTOM COLOR. 	The custom color option will bring up a dialog box, from which you can choose thousands of colors and combinations of colors by clicking on the color you want (and then clicking "OK").  TIP: Be sure not to choose something like black or white because that hides some of the buttons and options of the program.<br><br>


<b>HELP BUTTON:</b> Help has two options: <b>Help Manual</b> (which is what you are reading now!) and <b>Copyright</b> (which brings up a dialog box with copyright information).<br><br><br>
